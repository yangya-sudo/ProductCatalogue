# TMF620_ProductCatalog
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Product Catalog API

Provides a standardized solution for rapidly adding partnersâ€™ products to an existing Catalog. It brings the
capability for Service Providers to directly feed partners systems with the technical description of the products
they propose to them.

The Admin swagger file provides a schema with the complete set of operations to manage a catalog while the regular
swagger file provides a schema with only those set of operations that a regular user needs to use a catalog.

To access this API; (the Specification, Postman Collection, Swagger file, Swagger-UI, 
Reference Implementation, Conformance Profile, and CTK) go to the Open API table at:
